Korte tekst van wat je juist gaat laten zien.
En minit uitleg wat Bob is eventueel met een link naar een kort fimplje of zo

### result
Bob is an AI software development partner that understands developer intent, repository structure, and enterprise security standards. Built by IBM, Project BOB assists developers and integration specialists by providing context-aware explanations, implementation guidance, and code-level assistance grounded in existing repositories and organizational constraints.

In this fast-track snack, I demonstrate how BOB inspects repository contents, reasons over existing code and configuration artifacts, and supports controlled code changes. The focus is on practical applicability: what BOB can support today, how it reduces cognitive overhead during development and troubleshooting, and how it complements established integration tooling.

### spoken version
Bob is an AI software development partner that understands your intent, your repository, and the security standards you work within. Built by IBM, Project BOB is designed to assist developers and integration specialists by providing context-aware guidance, explanations, and code assistance grounded in real project context.

In this short demo, I’ll show how BOB analyzes repository content, reasons over existing code and configuration, and helps with managing code changes. The focus is purely practical: what BOB can help with today, how it speeds up development and troubleshooting, and how it fits alongside existing integration tooling.
