# A Week at IBM TechXchange Early eXperience Program in Hursley

## Introduction

Last week, I had the opportunity to attend the IBM TechXchange early eXperience program for IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE) at the historic Hursley House in England. This event was a blend of insightful sessions, hands-on labs, and valuable networking with IBM architects, developers, and business partners from around the globe. With 160 attendees representing over 50 organizations and 25 countries, it was a truly diverse and enriching experience.

## Impressions

The venue, Hursley House, added a touch of grandeur to the event. Nestled in expansive grounds, the house is impressive and provides a welcoming atmosphere. IBM went out of their way to make us feel at home. The combination of the historical setting and cutting-edge technology discussions was unique and memorable.

## The Event

The program spanned five days and was packed with a mix of sessions and labs. The agenda was rather tight, and although the sessions were informative, we had limited time for the hands-on labs. Some standout sessions included:

- ACE vNext Overview: This provided a sneak peek into the upcoming features and direction of ACE.
- Discovery Connectors: A deep dive into the new connectors being introduced.
- Log Node Enhancements: Detailed insights into the improvements in the logging capabilities of ACE.
- ACEcc, CP4I, ACEaaS updates: What's new and improved in the container landscape.

Despite the packed schedule, the labs offered a hands-on experience with the latest tools and features, though the time allocated was less than ideal.

## Networking and Interactions

One of the most valuable aspects of the week was the opportunity to meet and reconnect with professionals in the integration space. The diversity of attendees, both in terms of geographical representation and professional background, made for enriching discussions and exchanges of ideas.

## Personal Insights

Attending the IBM TechXchange early eXperience program at Hursley has given me a deeper understanding of where ACE is headed and what IBM's key priorities are for the future. The insights gained from the sessions and interactions with the development teams and fellow attendees have been invaluable. From the historical setting of Hursley House to the forward-looking discussions on ACE, it was a perfect blend of past, present, and future. While I can't delve into specific technical details due to NDA constraints, I can say that the future of ACE looks promising, and I'm excited to see how the product continues to evolve.

Many thanks to the countless IBM-ers who helped organize and successfully guide the program to fruition.
