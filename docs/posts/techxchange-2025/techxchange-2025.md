# IBM TechXchange 2025, Orlando. Overwhelming in all the right ways.

What can we say other than: amazing. There, that’s all you needed to know. Moving on.

Just kidding. There's way more to say, probably too much. So let me stick to the highlights.

My colleague [Jef](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jef-jansen/) and I were this year’s delegates for [Integration Designers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/integrationdesigners/). 
We came, we saw, we got absolutely steamrolled by the scale of it all.

Think ten interesting sessions at the same time, plus fun distractions, a scavenger hunt, four hundred plus champions 
running around, marathon walks in the sandbox, and just enough time left to grab another caffeine hit before sprinting 
to the next thing. And boy, did we need the caffeine.

Not into the tech stuff? Feel free to skip ahead to the fun bits. Your loss, obviously.

## Tech

There was no escaping it: AI was everywhere. Panels, demos, slides, code, whiteboards. Even the hallway conversations. 
A lot of talk about agentic patterns, multi-modal interfaces, orchestration, MCP, and the usual “let's throw AI at it 
and hope it works.” Some of it was solid. Some of it still felt like a concept in search of a reason.

If you haven’t heard of Project Bob yet, you will. It’s IBM’s new AI-first IDE, designed to modernize your codebase and 
then help you refactor, test, document, and deploy it. Not a toy. Not just another Copilot. The sessions around Bob were 
packed, and rightly so. It doesn’t feel like vaporware or vibe-coding. Looking forward to giving it a try.

Cloud wasn’t in the spotlight, not directly at least. Everything runs on cloud now, so in a way, it was everywhere. But 
attention has clearly shifted toward AI. That being said, there were still plenty of focused sessions: CP4I updates, 
serverless, IaC, hybrid cloud patterns, you name it.

App integration had a strong presence too, especially with how AI and MCP are being woven into products like ACE and MQ. 
The sessions weren’t just theory or roadmaps. There were live demos, real examples, and honest discussions about what 
actually works. Not flawless, but useful and interesting.

Of course, this is just a slice. There were tracks for everything from Z to Red Hat to Storage to FinOps. Whether you 
were deep in APIs, creaking older tech, or catching up on the latest, there was a place to belong rather than just 
spectate. You could stay in your niche, jump across tracks, or just sit somewhere quiet and let it all absorb.

## Partners

## Community 

Monday was officially “Community Day,” but all week long the community presence was real. Not just a few panels. Over 90 
community‑related sessions. MQ Global. Instanauts Global. IHWI, pronounced “Eye-H-Why” to avoid it sounding like “wee” 
in English. And the Assistants & Agents User Group Event. Just to name a few that spring to mind.

Most rooms were busy. Some had more people than seats. People weren’t there to kill time between keynotes. They were 
engaged, asking good questions, and showing actual interest. You could feel the buzzword version of it, engagement, 
but without the cringe.

I joined an integration breakout that led to some solid conversations. Met a few new people. Talked shop. Covered a bunch 
of ground on the integration stack, from pain points to patterns that actually work. Direct, useful, no time-wasting.

I’m not going to list all 90 of those sessions (we’d still be here tomorrow) but the sheer volume meant there was 
something for every flavor. Whether you were deep in APIs, creaking older tech, or trying to catch up on the latest, 
there was a place to belong rather than just spectate. And a lot of love for Z, showcased by the huge crowd for the live 
unboxing of the Z17.

## Champions

Sunday afternoon was Champions welcome day. And yes, I finally got my coveted blue jacket. That alone made the trip worth 
it. But more than that, it was a moment where Champions were genuinely put center stage. Not in a “here’s a badge” kind 
of way, but in the sense that IBM made time and space to thank people for the work they put in throughout the year.

That included the Champion Challenges. Mini missions across the year that earned you an extra patch for your jacket. So 
if you see someone walking around with one of those, now you know. It wasn’t just for showing up.

The Champion program ran all week. We had our own sessions, lounge access, roundtables, early entries, private 
networking events, and even a group photo session. There were panels, tech tours, feedback sessions, and a hands-on 
lightboard training for those who signed up. Basically, if you were a Champion and still managed to get bored, that’s 
on you.

Universal was a standout. Champions got fast pass wristbands, which turned networking into ride, scream, repeat. The 
main event at The Pointe on Wednesday evening at 7 PM wrapped it all up. Food, drinks, karaoke, and a mechanical bull. 
Because obviously. And a lot of people who had already lost their voice from talking all week.

It wasn’t just perks though. A good chunk of us were also speaking, running sessions, or helping out with community 
activities. Being a Champion isn’t a spectator role. You earn the jacket, and then you keep earning it.

And if you’re wondering, nobody actually yelled “Being a Champion is hard work” while flying off the mechanical bull, 
as far as I know.

## AI 

Agentic AI. THE thing everybody is raving about for the last year, give or take. Not suprisingly, it was EVERYWHERE. You 
couln't joint a sessions and not hear the word "agentic". Some people will love it, others will loath it. It suffices to
say, we haven't seen the last of it and AI Agents are here to stay. And evolve. 

Second main topic, MCP just like agentic you see it coming back in a lot of products, even ACE and MQ.
Since it's hot of the press for all the dev teams, a lot has been build in parallell but not based on 
one another, expect more things to come soon, now that they have all layed the groundwork for future entanglement

...

## The experts
Let's not forget the people behind the event. All the IBM experts that must have been bombarded with the same questions over
and over again. Keeping a cool head and patiently answering all of our million questions. Steadily going on with their 
presentations while people are entering, or leaving, in the middle of their speech (I would absolutely hate that). But 
the sheer number of sessions 


## Fun

Now, on to the fun bit, because you can't survive on work alone. And yes, community matters. You could feel it everywhere: 
in the sandbox, at the block party, in the scavenger hunt chaos. Unless you’ve got fast track passes for a theme park, 
then priorities tend to shift.

Let’s start with the sandbox. Easily one of the best parts of the event. Hands-on, slightly chaotic, and full of things 
you didn’t plan to do but somehow ended up doing anyway. Playing around with tech, poking at AI-driven demos, classic 
pinball, MarioKart on a giant screen, labs everywhere, certifications happening in the background, and food and drinks 
always nearby. There was even a version of Space Invaders where your spaceship was generated by AI based on your prompt. 
That one went off the rails fast, with some surprisingly clever results. Not as simple as it looked.

The opening night block party? DJ, food, lights, and a lot of people who had already lost track of what day it was. Day 
one for most. Day two if you were a Champion. I partially blame the jetlag. Solid way to kick things off.

Then the sticker scavenger hunt. Sounds harmless until you see grown adults power-walking across the venue in search of 
that one missing sticker. Some took it very seriously. I may or may not have been one of them. There was a prize 
involved. Enough said.

And finally, Universal Islands of Adventure. IBM booked the whole park just for attendees. Rides, food, drinks, all 
included. Champions got fast track passes. Yes, skip the line fast track passes. No queues. Just walk on, ride, repeat. 
The mood went from “whoo, Champions” to “boo, Champions” real quick once the skipping started. All in good fun, allegedly.
