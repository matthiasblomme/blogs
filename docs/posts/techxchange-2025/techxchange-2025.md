# TechXchange 2025: that's a wrap

IBM TechXchange 2025 Orlando, what can we say other then amazing! There that's all ou needed to know. Until next time.

Just kidding. There is loads more to say, too much even. So let me stick to the highlight. My colleague [Jef]() 
and myself where this years delegates for [Integration Designers](), we came, we saw, and we were blown away.
The event itself was huge, spread out over the OCCC and the Hilton

If you are not interested in the _boring_ tech topics (your opinion, not mine), but just want to know about the fun bits
(and they were fun) , feel free to skip over the next chapters. Your loss ;)


## Tech, Partners, Community and Champions

Without using the obvious 2 letter acronym (which I will, later), these were the 4 main topics here. Aside from the fun

(but again, more on that later). 

### Tech

Meet bob


### Partners

Monday special partner sessions

### Community 

Live community user groups

### Champions

Sunday afternoon for champions

## AI 

Agentic AI. THE thing everybody is raving about for the last year, give or take. Not suprisingly, it was EVERYWHERE. You 
couln't joint a sessions and not hear the word "agentic". Some people will love it, others will loath it. It suffices to
say, we haven't seen the last of it and AI Agents are here to stay. And evolve.

## MCP


## The experts
Let's not forget the people behind the event. All the IBM experts that must have been bombarded with the same questions over
and over again. Keeping a cool head and patiently answering all of our million questions. Steadily going on with their 
presentations while people are entering, or leaving, in the middle of their speech (I would absolutely hate that). But 
the sheer number of sessions 


## Fun

Now, on to the fun bit, because you can't survive on work alone. And have I already mentioned that community is key? Unless
you get fast track passes for a theme park that is ;)

fun: sandbox
fun: opening night block party
fun: universal islands of adventure, and champions got a fasttrack pass.
