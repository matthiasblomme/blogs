# IBM TechXchange 2025, Orlando. Overwhelming in all the right ways.

What can we say other than: amazing. There, that’s all you needed to know. Moving on.

Just kidding. There's way more to say, probably too much. So let me stick to the highlights.

My colleague [Jef](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jef-jansen/) and I were this year’s delegates for [Integration Designers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/integrationdesigners/). 
We came, we saw, we got absolutely steamrolled by the scale of it all.

Think ten interesting sessions at the same time, plus fun distractions, a scavenger hunt, four hundred plus champions 
running around, marathon walks in the sandbox, and just enough time left to grab another caffeine hit before sprinting 
to the next thing. And boy, did we need the caffeine.

Not into the tech stuff? Feel free to skip ahead to the fun bits. Your loss, obviously.

## Tech, Partners, Community and Champions

Without using the obvious 2 letter acronym (which I will, later), these were the 4 main topics here. Aside from the fun

(but again, more on that later). 

### Tech

Meet bob

### Partners

Monday special partner sessions

### Community 

Live community user groups

### Champions

Sunday afternoon for champions

## AI 

Agentic AI. THE thing everybody is raving about for the last year, give or take. Not suprisingly, it was EVERYWHERE. You 
couln't joint a sessions and not hear the word "agentic". Some people will love it, others will loath it. It suffices to
say, we haven't seen the last of it and AI Agents are here to stay. And evolve.

## MCP


## The experts
Let's not forget the people behind the event. All the IBM experts that must have been bombarded with the same questions over
and over again. Keeping a cool head and patiently answering all of our million questions. Steadily going on with their 
presentations while people are entering, or leaving, in the middle of their speech (I would absolutely hate that). But 
the sheer number of sessions 


## Fun

Now, on to the fun bit, because you can't survive on work alone. And yes, community matters. You could feel it everywhere: 
in the sandbox, at the block party, in the scavenger hunt chaos. Unless you’ve got fast track passes for a theme park, 
then priorities tend to shift.

Let’s start with the sandbox. Easily one of the best parts of the event. Hands-on, slightly chaotic, and full of things 
you didn’t plan to do but somehow ended up doing anyway. Playing around with tech, poking at AI-driven demos, classic 
pinball, MarioKart on a giant screen, labs everywhere, certifications happening in the background, and food and drinks 
always nearby. There was even a version of Space Invaders where your spaceship was generated by AI based on your prompt. 
That one went off the rails fast, with some surprisingly clever results. Not as simple as it looked.

The opening night block party? DJ, food, lights, and a lot of people who had already lost track of what day it was. Day 
one for most. Day two if you were a Champion. I partially blame the jetlag. Solid way to kick things off.

Then the sticker scavenger hunt. Sounds harmless until you see grown adults power-walking across the venue in search of 
that one missing sticker. Some took it very seriously. I may or may not have been one of them. There was a prize 
involved. Enough said.

And finally, Universal Islands of Adventure. IBM booked the whole park just for attendees. Rides, food, drinks, all 
included. Champions got fast track passes. Yes, skip the line fast track passes. No queues. Just walk on, ride, repeat. 
The mood went from “whoo, Champions” to “boo, Champions” real quick once the skipping started. All in good fun, allegedly.
