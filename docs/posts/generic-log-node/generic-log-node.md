# Creating a generic log node using context trees

The comment from Craig Briscoe on my previous blog on using the context tree ()[] got me thinking, the ESQL 
context tree functions would be great for generating log files from a generic log node. 
I know, I know, a lot of you already have log solutions, but for those that don't, or for those interesting
in working with context trees, have a look at what my crazy mind thought of.
