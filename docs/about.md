# About Me

Hi, I’m **Matthias Blomme** 
I’m an **IBM Champion**, an **integration specialist**, and a bit of an **IT nerd**.

---

## 💻 Professional Side
- **Integration specialist** working with **IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE)** and **MQ**
- Focused on **ACE, MQ, Kubernetes, GitOps, CI/CD pipelines**, and doing things the right way (not just the easy way)
- Passion for **security**: I dig into CVEs, cipher lists, and compliance more than is probably healthy

---

## 🏋️ Personal Side
- Running a **home gym**
- Living with **2 black cats** and a flock of **chickens** 🐔
- Fan of **coffee, LEGO, Star Wars, sci-fi**, and the occasional tattoo with a story behind it
- Music: give me **metal, punk, and rock** (but spare me the overplayed classics)

---

## 🌍 Why I Blog
This blog is a mix of **technical notes**, **personal experiments**, and **stories**.  
It’s here to help me think out loud, share what works (and what doesn’t), and hopefully spark a discussion or two.
