# eMBee Integration Blogs ☕

Hi, I’m **Matthias Blomme**
I’m an **IBM Champion**, an **integration specialist**, and a bit of an **IT nerd**.

Welcome to my corner of the web.  

I write about **IBM Integration (ACE, MQ, DevOps)**, but also about the real, hands-on work of making tech run smoothly 
in modern environments. I'm trying to bring some AI in here as well

This blog is **not** marketing fluff.  
Expect walkthroughs, sharp opinions, and experiments straight out of my homelab (sometimes successful, sometimes… less so).

## 👋 Why “eMBee”?

It’s short for **Matthias Blomme** — and yeah, I like the bee vibe.  
Integration is like a hive: messy, noisy, but amazing when it works together.

Pull up a chair, grab a coffee (by all means, grab a couple), and let’s get into it.
