=== startup optimization ===

Ever sat waiting for an ACE container to wake up? Painful.

I wanted to see how far I could push startup times without touching the build. Turns out youâ€™ve got options. Some are rigid, some are flexible, all come with quirks.

In the blog I break down three approaches:
- base image (the slow baseline)
- prebaked image (fast but fixed at build)
- init container (flexible, runtime warm start)

The numbers speak for themselves.
