=== startup optimization ===

Ever sat waiting for an ACE container to wake up? Painful.

I wanted to see how far I could push startup times without touching the build. Turns out you’ve got options. Some are rigid, some are flexible, all come with quirks.

In the blog I break down three approaches:
- base image (the slow baseline)
- prebaked image (fast but fixed at build)
- init container (flexible, runtime warm start)

The numbers speak for themselves.

Hopefully not “whatever fits.”

This post doesn’t give you rules. It gives you questions. And the occasional opinionated take on how I scope ACE runtimes without making a mess.
