Big schema's = big compile and loading times

resources that impact each other = don't put 2 applications that have nothing to do with each other in the same container

resources for same endpoint (and same criticality) = can be easily and logically bundled

small number of resources that reuse the same lib = lib update will impact all of them, so logically they might belong together

build: compile when building! = limits startup time build and compile, more efficient

startup times (not to long) = monitor those, do a test or uat setup

criticality = dont put critical and non criticall apps together

scaling = if you want to scale something, don't combine withg those that don't need it

security = sensitive data might be bundled, but don't bundle it with a less secure flow

ownership = integrations with same resp might belong together

end2end or not = some integrations that are coupled could belong together

loosley coupled = integrations that are loosley coupled should not belong in the same container

misc: when using words as must, could, should, shouldn't, ... also define what they mean
